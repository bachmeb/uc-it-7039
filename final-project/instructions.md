Final Project  
Due Sunday by 11:59pm  Points 20  Submitting a file upload


Project Overview: 

The final project serves as the culminating point and capstone of the course, offering a comprehensive review and consolidation of the knowledge acquired throughout. In this final project, you’ll build upon the Flask application concepts from previous modules to create a fully functional web application. You may expand on the Task Master app or start a new app, as long as it includes multiple pages, user forms, and database functionality. You will engage in the development and deployment of a complete, full-stack web development product onto an AWS server. This hands-on experience allows you to showcase a mastery of the course content, emphasizing practical application and real-world deployment. 

Project Requirements: 

Application Structure & Features
Multiple Pages: Your application should include at least three distinct pages, each serving a specific purpose. 
Navigation: Users should be able to navigate back to the home page from any other page within the application. 
Form & Input Handling
User Input Form: Create a form to collect and manage user input effectively within the app. 

Database Integration
Database Use: Integrate a database to store and manage user data, with the option to use one or multiple tables. 
Sorting & Display Options: Allow users to sort and filter displayed results based on various criteria. 
CRUD Functionality: Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to enable user interactions with stored data. 

Design & Presentation
Styling: Apply CSS to ensure that the application is visually appealing and offers a positive user experience. 

Additional Features (Choose at least two)
This requirement is flexible, allowing you to explore and learn new tools that were not part of the Task Master app. Examples include: 

File Upload: Implement a feature to allow users to upload and store files or images within the app. 
Data Visualization: Use data visualization libraries to display user data as charts or graphs. 
Input Validation: Use Flask-WTF or similar tools to incorporate input validation and improve data accuracy. 
 

Grading Criteria: 

Your final grade will be evaluated based on the following: 

Deployment & Accessibility: Successful deployment on AWS, with public accessibility via the URL provided. 
Basic Functionality: How effectively each required feature works, including pages, CRUD operations. 
Additional Functionalities & Tools: Your exploration of new tools, as demonstrated through the implementation of at least two additional features. 
Design: The visual appeal, coherence, and overall user experience of the application. 
 

Submission Requirements: 

Prepare a project report that includes: 

Public URL: Start with the public URL of your application’s landing page (use the domain name, not the IP address). 

Project Description (< 500 words) : Describe your project and explain how you met each core requirement, including additional tools and features implemented. 

The report should clearly outline the functionality of your app and provide an overview of the skills you applied. Please point out all the additional features in your app that we may miss testing. 

Ensure that a link on your landing page leads directly to your project for easy access and evaluation.
